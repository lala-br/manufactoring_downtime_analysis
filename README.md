# Manufacturing Downtime & Productivity Analysis (Excel)
### Overview
This project analyzes productivity and downtime data for a soft drink bottling production line. Acting as a Production Manager, I evaluated line efficiency, identified key downtime drivers, and analyzed operator performance to uncover actionable improvement opportunities.

---

## Business Problem
A soft drink bottling line was experiencing **low operational efficiency and frequent downtime**, with no clear understanding of:

- Which operators were underperforming  
- What factors caused the most downtime  
- Where improvement efforts should be prioritized  

---

## 🧠 What I Did
- Calculated **overall and operator-level production efficiency**  
- Identified **high-impact downtime factors** using Pareto analysis  
- Built a **dynamic matrix** to analyze downtime by operator and error type  
- Translated analysis into **clear, actionable operational recommendations**

##Dataset
- Source: Internal manufacturing operations data
- Format: Excel workbook
- Tables:
  Line Productivity
  Products
  Downtime Factors
  Line Downtime
- Records: 38
- Fields: 12

## Key Results
- Overall line efficiency measured at **64%**  
- **Top 5 downtime factors caused ~80% of total downtime**  
- Identified one operator with consistently lower efficiency  
- Found that **3 of the 5 main downtime drivers were operator-related**  

> Results-focused insights show tangible business impact.

## Tools & Skills  
- Time-based KPI calculations  
- XLOOKUP & INDEX/MATCH  
- PivotTables & PivotCharts  
- Pareto Analysis  
- Conditional Formatting  
- Operational performance analysis  

---

## Business Recommendations
- Provide **machine adjustment training** for all operators  
- Deliver **targeted batch change training** for the underperforming operator  
- Strengthen **preventive maintenance** and inventory checks  

---

## Why This Matters
This project demonstrates my ability to:

- Turn operational data into **actionable business insights**  
- Identify root causes rather than symptoms  
- Communicate findings clearly to non-technical stakeholders  
- Use Excel as an **analytical tool**, not just a spreadsheet
